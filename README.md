# Authentication Log Analyzer (CYB333 Final Project)

**Author:** Jalah Rivers  
**Course:** CYB333 Security Automation  
**Project Type:** Individual Project

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based Authentication Log Analyzer designed to support security automation and incident response. The script reads authentication log entries, detects failed login attempts, counts failures per IP address, and flags suspicious IPs that exceed a configurable threshold.

This automation reduces the need for manual log review and helps identify possible brute-force behavior quickly.

## Features
- Parses authentication logs for failed password events
- Tracks failed attempts per IP address using a dictionary
- Flags suspicious IPs based on a threshold (default: 3)
- Saves findings to a report file for evidence/documentation
- Supports command-line arguments for flexible testing

## Files Included
- `main.py` — main analyzer script
- `sample_logs.txt` — sample authentication log file
- `sample_logs_2.txt` — extended sample log file (more failed attempts)
- `suspicious_report.txt` — output report generated by the script
- `auth_log_analyzer.ipynb` — notebook documentation + evidence
- `README.md` — project documentation

## How to Run
From the project folder:

```bash
python main.py -f sample_logs_2.txt -t 3 -o suspicious_report.txt

Security & Ethics Note

This project uses sample logs for educational purposes and is intended for defensive monitoring and incident response. It should only be used on systems and logs you are authorized to analyze.

AI Tools Used

GitHub Copilot was used for syntax assistance and quick suggestions while coding. All logic and implementation decisions were reviewed and finalized by the author.
