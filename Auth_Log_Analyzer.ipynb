    "# Authentication Log Analyzer (CYB333 Final Project)\n",
    "**Author:** Jalah Rivers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Purpose\n",
    "Build a Python-based Authentication Log Analyzer that:\n",
    "- parses authentication logs,\n",
    "- counts failed login attempts per IP address,\n",
    "- flags suspicious IPs that exceed a threshold,\n",
    "- outputs a report for incident response evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why this matters for Security Automation\n",
    "Manual log review is slow and error-prone. This tool automates detection of brute-force indicators by quickly summarizing failed authentication activity and identifying IPs that require investigation.\n"

    "1. Created project folder and files in VS Code.\n",
    "2. Wrote `main.py` to parse authentication logs and count failures per IP.\n",
    "3. Generated realistic sample logs with multiple failed attempts.\n",
    "4. Tested the script using a threshold value (ex: `-t 3`).\n",
    "5. Verified output both in terminal and in the saved report file.\n",
    "6. Documented results and evidence in this notebook.\n"

    "## Results\n",
    "- The analyzer successfully counted failed login attempts per IP.\n",
    "- Any IP meeting or exceeding the threshold was flagged as suspicious.\n",
    "- The script produced a clean report that can be attached as IR evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reflection\n",
    "This project made log analysis feel practical instead of abstract. Building the parser showed me how “small automation” can save real time in incident response. It also helped me understand how brute-force behavior can be recognized quickly through repeated failures, especially when the same IP shows consistent authentication errors.\n"
